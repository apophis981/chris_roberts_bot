It’s been a lot of fun and a lot of work. It’s pretty amazing, because I never guessed it would’ve turned into what it’s turned into when we started out. I was just hoping there was a big enough group of people out there that still wanted a space game like the kind I made so I could go off and make it. Obviously we’re way beyond that. We’ve been able to build this really large company that’s dedicated to making the best space game possible. We now have over 360 people in four studios spread between L.A., Austin, Manchester and Frankfurt. We also have folks working on it up in Montreal. It’s pretty amazing that from this one idea, this big company has grown and evolved, and of course that comes with its own set of work. There’s a challenge to build and grow a company while trying to build a really ambitious game.
And it’s really interesting that we’re doing it in public. All the past games I’ve built have been built behind closed doors, and have been funded by a publisher. You’d go off and work on something for several years before you even show it to people. With Star Citizen, from the very beginning, we were just like, “Hey! This is what we’re doing!” That is exhilarating, and it’s great to get feedback and all that stuff, but of course that can have unfavorable consequences. But I’d rather take the good with the bad.
The biggest takeaway for me is the community. In the past, all the games I’ve made — I knew that people liked them, they got all these reviews — but you never really connected to the people that liked the game or what you were doing. That’s not what happens with a crowdfunded game. We have this huge, supportive community, and over the last four years they’ve supported us to a level no other crowdfunding game has seen before. They make this game possible. It’s amazing to see their excitement and enthusiasm.

You have this direct connection to the players, and there’s something really cool about that — not just for me, but for a lot of the people working on this stuff. When they build a cool ship or they build a cool feature, all these people say, “Ahh, I really like that, it’s really cool!” A lot of times when you’re creating something, you’re doing it for yourself, but you also want to do it so other people enjoy it. If you’re working on a triple-A game, you could be locked up for four years before knowing whether anyone likes it or not or is even excited about it. In our case, we know there’s a big community out there that’s super excited and can’t get enough of it.
Star Citizen is pretty much the game I’ve been wanting to build for all my life. If you look at the history of games I’ve built, you sort of see bits of it along the way. When I was a kid, I’d watch things like Star Wars and Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica. I read a lot of science fiction. I imagined living in this future world, but the technology never felt like it was there. Wing Commander was specifically done the way it was done to work with the technology at that time to be immersive in that world and story, but we were on a pretty constrained path relative to what we’re doing in Star Citizen.
You can do whatever profession you want to do. You can go to all these various locations, wander around worlds, fly ships, and have it all done in this detail that you would imagine you could project yourself in as a person. It’s not abstract. It’s not looking at the exterior of a 3D ship. It’s actually walking around inside the ship; it’s sitting in the captain’s chair, flying in and landing and getting up and walking around on the planet you’ve landed on. I’ve always wanted to do that.
We’re planning to get about 100 star systems in the game. Each star system will have anywhere from one to six planets, and then there will obviously be moons, space stations, asteroid fields and all the rest of the stuff. You’ll have oceans and forests and mountains, different homesteads and locations, as well as the landing areas. There’s going to be a huge increase in the play area and what people can do, and we’re really going for a kind of frequency of interaction and interest and AI and everything that is much more dense than what you’d typically get in a space game.
Normally you’d go to a star system and maybe there would be one or two locations you could land on, you buy or sell stuff, and then you’d go to another location. With Star Citizen just one star system should have enough content and enough things to do for players to play for hundreds, even thousands of hours. The density of experience is going to be much higher than what you’ve seen in other space games, including my own.
We actually have a full universe simulation that runs on separate servers, responsible for deciding which planets are trading, which organization is doing what, which factories are doing well, who’s selling what, who needs what kind of goods. It’s populating the universe with the various people going about their jobs, whether it’s a pirate, trader, bounty hunter, law enforcer — they’re all running around in this universe simulation, and then we use that simulation to drive the content that people interact with when they’re flying around in the universe.

The whole concept is to have a living, breathing universe that reacts and responds to the players’ actions. We’re doing things like items, ships or even characters that age, wear and tear. You need to make sure that you’re servicing your spaceship or your equipment, otherwise it’s gets damaged. The idea is that nothing in this world should feel static. It should feel like your actions, and your friends’ actions, have an impact. And the world moves on whether you’re participating or not. I think that makes the game quite different from a lot of the MMOs out there. We obviously haven’t got all this working; it’s all in different stages of development, but that’s the long-term vision — a dynamic, living, breathing universe where you can just go off and spend as long as you want in it.
I’m building the game that I wanted to build. There’s been a vast amount of long hours and assets just to get it here, and there’s still going to be a lot more long hours and assets to get it online. But I’m building it because it’s something that I want to play. I have no doubt in every fiber of my being that we will deliver the game that I see in my head and the game that I think will be really great, and I think my team is like-minded. In any endeavor, there’s always people who say, “It’s too ambitious. You won’t make it.” But there’s a Chinese proverb: Those who think it can’t be done should get out of the way of those who are doing it. I very much ascribe to that.
    If you take a look and see what we’ve shared over the years and the progress we’ve made, there’s a lot of things people said we couldn’t do that we are doing right now. We are doing some things on a scale and scope and complexity that no other game has achieved. Yes, we aren’t finished yet, and we have a lot more stuff to do. But for me, that’s more just a matter of time. Are we always going to be on time, are we always going to make dates? No. In all software development I’ve been a part of, it never happens that way. Our attitude is that we’re going for quality.

    The only worry that I have is losing the support of the community. That’s what’s enabling us to make the game that we’re making right now. As long as we have the support of the community, I have no doubt that we will make this amazing game. Now whether that’s the amazing game that everyone out there wants, I can’t say. Everyone has their own particular vision of what they think is the thing they need. But I will say I have a pretty good feeling that what we will deliver will satisfy and impress a good amount of people. I really believe it. We’re basically combining a lot of the things you’ve never had in one game before. It’s going to take us longer to get to that nirvana of it all, but I think it will be something very special.

    People can complain about dates and timelines, but what they really want is a great experience. We’re not doing just a single player game. We have this open-world universe, that you can venture around in for years to come. You don’t want to cut corners — you want to build it right. Something that’ll last for a long time — that’s my goal. I’m not looking at this game like I’m going to finish it and then move on to the next game. This is it. This is going to be a living product, a living world. It will evolve with content, features, graphical capabilities. It will be a constantly living product getting bigger, better and richer over the years. When you do that, you need to make sure the foundation is right.
Have to wait a little longer. It’s going really well, not showing it at Gamescom because Chris wants it at a certain level of polish. Lots of things they show in AtV, and some from 3.0, is specifically being used for SQ42. Some things like the Planet tech has also gone into SQ42 too. There are cases where you go down on moons or planets. Lots of high quality performance and motion capture data, making sure that when characters are moving they look great and fluid going from AI pathing to merging scenes with characters. Trying to make you feel like you’re part of the story and not just hanging with AI. It will be worth the wait.
Planetary tech. This will be the first time the community can go and land, in the case of 3.0, moons or an asteroid planetoid. Fully realized, can circumnavigate the whole thing if you wanted to. The amount of additional playable area that comes into the game now is huge, the game will open up a lot because of that planetary tech. It’s really exciting, there’ s a lot of gameplay that will come out of it, and it’s one of the reasons things are taking longer than they’d like. Once they’ve opened up the potential of the planets though, they need to make sure there’s stuff to do. They’re not just creating the planets, but also systems, eco systems, flora, fauna, things to make it alive, things to do, things to procedurally create outposts or towns or villages beyond just the landing zones. The original version of SC was aiming to be more like Freelancer; couldn’t explore the landing zones. You’d go from in orbit to transition to a few locations in a town. Now they have whole worlds opened up. Amount of potential for exploration long-term, and for players to do things, create their own base or settlement, lots of gameplay potential. Just seeing the beginnings of it in 3.0.
Trying very much to get the quality of the animation and the AI movement to be equivalent to what you see in prerendered cinematics. They spent time shooting with actors, 100 days of performance capture. Most big movies won’t shoot for more than 100 days. For the amount that CIG have, there’s a vast amount of performance data and animation and story, really want to make sure it comes across so when you’re playing and moving around and talking to Old Man or the various other characters that you’re playing the game alongside, because you’re basically in a movie as opposed to Wing Commander 3 and 4, you were the stuntman flying the ship, then you’d see what Mark Hamill does, in this case it’s you, you just happen to be the lead star in the movie. Getting that to the fluidity they want, cause it’s a huge story, it taking longer than anticipated.
They’re still working on final assets, but all the missions and chapters are blocked out. Each chapter would be several missions in say Wing Commander. They’re somewhere between white and grey boxes. They’re taking certain levels to finished. One section of the story they were talking about last year they’re still doing. They’ll be showing something at some point, but not this gamescom, and Chris would hate to make promises cause last year he said they wanted to, but it didn’t get to the point they were happy with and everyone was upset, and Chris felt back because they still showed some fantastic stuff, which in Chris’ mind was great stuff, but the hype of that was affected by them not showing SQ42. Animations and AI, going for a level of AI you don’t normally have, so when you’re on a ship you’re serving on, the Stanton which is an Idris, all the crew have a schedule. They get up in the morning, go eat breakfast, go to their job, eat after dinner, etc… and sleep, there’s a whole schedule and cycle. Almost a level of sims simulation for AI. They’ll also use that for the PU. Dialing that in while getting subsumption working; in 3.0 all missions run off subsumption, and in SQ everything uses subsumption now too, whereas before it used an older cryengine system. Getting everything dialed in to look as good or better than everything else.
Kind of hard to say. They build the game to support everything, from joystick to gamepad to KBM. All have pros and cons. For running around on foot FPS, KBM is probably best, for flying Joystick probably is. Mouse flight might be too easy or give an edge, but when they show stuff off, and Chris doesn’t want to spoil Friday, but it’s better to have a joystick. For Chris, he hasn’t set it up yet, but a nice wide monitor, 4k across, switch between HOTAS and MKB.
In the case of Star Citizen, the concept of finishing a game is probably pretty loose. The time they stop adding stuff is probably when it dies as an online game. They’ll always add features and content to keep it alive. The moment they stop adding functionality, that’s when the game’s dead. EVE 10 years later, WoW, etc…
Why version 1.0? At this moment if you back SC, you can download 2.6.3, 3.0 very soon, you’ll be able to go from moons. In 3.1 when Hurston and Stanton are in, you’re getting the game as it happens. It’s not like we’re not giving it to you till a certain point, traditionally a publisher’ll work on a game, they’ll tell you about it, but you won’t get to play it till right before it comes out. You’re not playing what EA’s developing two or three years before they’re building it. With SC, the idea of a finish line in a SC sense doesn’t make sense. They have a fairly set set of general features, but as new things come online like the planetary tech, they need to do new things to make things interesting, so they add new things to make it good, and ultimately Chris wants to make the most interesting experience he can. He wants to get it to the point where he feels like he’s adding additional stuff vs. getting the basic functionality in.
When I said I missed old school difficulty to gaming you probably didn’t think that I would make the pledge process more difficult than fighting the toughest boss monster in Demon’s Souls!

Well neither did I!

Wednesday morning we set out to prove that PC gaming and Space Sims are not dead… and prove it, we did!

We’re absolutely floored by the attention and humbled by your comments. We hoped everyone would be excited about the big idea behind Star Citizen and Squadron 42 — but we had no expectation about the kind of praise and interest we received yesterday.

The downside of all this attention was that the huge number of people from all around the world trying to learn about Star Citizen and make their pledge, crashed our custom crowd funding page and also took down the core community site.

Until then, we were on track to break crowd funding records. Now, thirty hours later, we’re only just getting the core site back online. The proper crowd funding page is still unfortunately down, but we have a backup site that, while not having the full range of features we intended, can take people’s pledges. With this site we have to update the data manually as there is no way to easily collect the crowd funding statistics on a live basis, which is why you haven’t seen a counter on the backup site. We are working very hard to get the main crowd funding plug in to play nice with the rest of the site, so we can deliver the seamless experience we envisioned when opting to have the crowd funding integrated into the main community site. Don’t worry, no one has lost their golden ticket, and we will ensure that everyone who makes a pledge on the backup site is connected to their community account. Please be patient while we organize this process.

We didn’t just set out to raise money to build a game; we set out to build a community. The intention was never to shut off the forums, disable the Golden Tickets or stop the flow of information after the launch; anything but. We hope you’ll bear with us as we get the community back online. The features you’ve enjoyed for the past month will continue — the Comm-Link, RSI Museum and Time Capsule — along with much more information about Star Citizen and chances to interact with its development team. As we move forward in this endeavor, you are our strongest asset; a vanguard of dedicated fans who will help us build and promote this game.

If you’re one of the lucky few warriors that snuck past the Java trolls and WordPress goblins to access the pledge site yesterday, thank you so much for your dedication.

If not, we promise we’ve beaten back these evil interlopers and ask you to pledge and spread the word to make this new universe possible. We are listening to you on the forums, are committed to giving you daily updates and will be rolling out some exciting new features in the coming days that hopefully make up for our initial snafu.

We lost the opportunity to break the first day record, but the race isn’t over yet! We currently stand at {
    55, 590 raised from 4,564 pledges which is pretty impressive considering the outage we’ve had. Seems everyone wants the RSI Constellation and physical goodies!

    But we need get this up. Space Sims trumped RPGs in the old days, let’s get a little of that inter-genre friendly rivalry back!

    If you haven’t made your pledge yet, please do as I would hate for the technical problems to have derailed our initial momentum. We still have a ways to go but I have no doubt with your support we will get there. This is our chance to tell the world: PC gaming and space sims are BACK!
